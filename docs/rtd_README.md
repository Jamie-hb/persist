# PersiST

PersiST is an exploratory method for analysing spatial transcriptomics (and other spatial 'omics) datsets. Given a spatial transcriptomics data set containing expression data on multiple genes, resolved to a shared set of co-ordinates (for example, Visium type spatial transcriptomics data), PersiST computes a single score for each gene that measures the amount of spatial structure that gene shows in it's expression pattern, called the *Coefficient of Spatial Structure* (CoSS). This score can be used for multiple analytical tasks, as we show below.

# Installation

PersiST can be installed using pip:

```python3 -m pip install persist_spatial```
